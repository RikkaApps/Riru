# Riru

Riru only does one thing, inject into zygote in order to allow modules run their codes in apps or the system server.

> The name, Riru, comes from a character. (https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=74128856)

## Requirements

Android 6.0+ devices rooted with [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) v19.0.

## Guide

### Install

* Automatically

  1. Search "Riru" in Magisk Manager
  2. Install the module named "Riru"

* Manually

  1. Download the zip from [GitHub release](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases)
  2. Install in Magisk Manager (Modules - Install from storage - Select downloaded zip)

**Before Magisk canary 21006, the first installation requires manual restart twice.**

### Config

* When the file `/data/adb/riru/disable` exists, Riru will do nothing
* When the file `/data/adb/riru/enable_hide` exists, the hide mechanism will be enabled (also requires the support of the modules)

## How Riru works?

* How to inject into zygote process?

  Before v22.0, we use the method of replacing a system library (libmemtrack) that will be loaded by zygote. However, it seems to cause some weird problems. Maybe because libmemtrack is used by something else.

  Then we found a super easy way, the "native bridge" (`ro.dalvik.vm.native.bridge`). The specific "so" file will be automatically "dlopen-ed" and "dlclose-ed" by the system. This way is from [here](https://github.com/canyie/NbInjection).

* How to know if we are in an app process or a system server process?

  Some JNI functions (`com.android.internal.os.Zygote#nativeForkAndSpecialize` & `com.android.internal.os.Zygote#nativeForkSystemServer`) is to fork the app process or the system server process.
  So we need to replace these functions to ours. This part is simple, hook `jniRegisterNativeMethods` since all Java native methods in `libandroid_runtime.so` is registered through this function.
  Then we can call the original `jniRegisterNativeMethods` again to replace them.
  
## How hide Hide works?

From v22.0, Riru provide a hide mechanism (idea from [Haruue Icymoon](https://github.com/haruue)), make the memory of Riru and module to anonymous memory to hide from "`/proc/maps` string scanning".

## Build

> Android Studio (at least until 4.2 Canary 13) can't correctly handle local module using prefab, you may have to manually run ":riru:assembleDebug" to make Android Studio happy

Run gradle task `:riru:assembleRelease` `:core:assembleRelease` task from Android Studio or the terminal, zip will be saved to `out`.
